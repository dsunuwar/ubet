# Introduction
In this coding excercise, i will setup a server for API to live on. I will use Node.js, back-end implementation of JavaScript, and Express framework for Node.

For the Front-end, i will use latest Angular CLI to generate seed project and build from there. I will also use Twitter Bootstrap for UI framework. The Bootstrap will provide me css style reset, responsive grid, buttons, and card.

## Development server
From terminal, go to project root directory.
- Run `npm run start`

This will start two servers, one for Front-end and other for backend. 
Next, navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. 

## Production Build 
Run `npm run build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. 

## Running unit tests
Run `npm run test` to execute the unit tests.
